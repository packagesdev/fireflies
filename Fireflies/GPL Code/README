How to build this thing on Mac OS X:

1) This screen effect is using the gfx library.

The sources for this library are in the archive libgfx-1.0.1.tar.gz. It can be easily compiled on Mac OS X using the command line. For lazy people (like me), I included the compiled static library in the libgfx folder.

2) As it's supposed to be, all you have to do to compile is to open the Fireflies.pbproj folder and type Command + B.
